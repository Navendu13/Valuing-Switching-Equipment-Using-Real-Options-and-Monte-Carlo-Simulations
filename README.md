# ⚡ Valuing Switching Equipment Using Real Options & Monte Carlo Simulations

This Excel-based project applies real options analysis to assess the value of installing switching equipment between natural gas and heating oil. Monte Carlo simulations are used to model stochastic price paths and evaluate cost-effectiveness under uncertainty.

## 📁 File
- `Valuing Switching Equipment.xlsx`: Contains data inputs, simulation models, and valuation outputs.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Model price uncertainty using Monte Carlo methods
- Estimate expected value of flexibility in energy switching
- Evaluate investment decision using real options framework

## 📊 Methodology
- Simulated price paths for natural gas and heating oil
- Applied real options logic to capture switching flexibility
- Computed expected savings and value under multiple scenarios

## ✅ Outcomes
- Quantified the economic value of optionality in fuel switching
- Provided investment guidance using stochastic cost models
- Enhanced risk-informed capital decision-making process

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (with built-in stochastic simulation)
